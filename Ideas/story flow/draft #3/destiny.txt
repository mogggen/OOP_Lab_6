Idea "fixing time travel charges"

using simple parity math to predict the end of the game. and reveal it to the player at the start.

just like how stockfish knows that you are garanteed to get mated in X moves,
you still feel like you have a chance to prevent the outcome, you might not even see it.
until it is right infront of you, and way to late to avoid.

what if instead of certain games of chess being doomed.
what if ALL the games were rigged to be forced checkmate in X moves?


now how would one go about this in practice

rules and legal moves are what determines the outcome of any chess position.
so let's make some rules for this game

there is a point in space time, easy enough

this point stores information about the current state of the world at this time

why would you want to move in time?
conflict the game won't have a legal system set in place, just bad actors.
these criminals will slaughter anyone, steal anything, vote selfishly, ruin the economy.
actually any actor given the opertunity, will mostly likely perform one or multiple crimes,
if they belive they will get away with it

motivations:
"the opertunity makes the theif"
"emergencies has no law"


Draft #3.1
simple, boring solution:
create a utopia without criminals

this won't be possible since there is an incentive to be neferious, because it requires less work.

Draft #3.2.2
when not all timelines can form a tree (or a forest)

Scenario #1: game over.
Scenario #2: something else entirely.

Draft #3.2.1
develop a series of ideas that shape a game that every non-linearly is technically a "checkmate"

like the "how predictable are you" solution.
(like having certain rifts open so that you can only walk into the ones that seals your destiny,
the other ones will be out of reach and you won't be able to reach them in time.
but somehow the game will be convincing enough to make you believe that you can.)

or the "chess engine" solution.

or use the determenistic, yet random, utilities of 3x + 1

or a combination of any of the select few.

or find even more material that could be implemented and improved to match the theme.


The character
this will be a single player game set in a finite space, let's say 64 squares

# scenario 1 LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

setup:
maybe start with a 4x4
and 3 actors
and 4 time travel charges (?)
a voting station
viewing range of 2, else fog of war
any actor can perform a kill (let's say that they don't require a weapon to do so just yet)

----
 X
   P
O
----

the viewing range, in this version's primal state, is to determine if a actor can spot a murder

let's say actor P murders actor X, unbeknownst to actor O you are currently playing as actor O

perspective: actor O

see nothing in particular, until the actor makes a innocent stroll around the game world.
and sees actor P standing close to a body.

actor P disappeared infront of actor O, where did actor P go?

perspective: actor P

actor P ends up where actor X was birthed, as actor X

everything is diffrent here, this is the origin story of actor X

version 1: it either existed during the world generation,
version 2: or was generated to fit the present of actor O in some fashion
time to begin your new life in this past world,
you can kill yourself to death out of there to to keep traveling back in time
(murder a woman if you want the possibility of traveling to their children's adulencence, of course :))

(the deterministic algorithm can generate any number of past realities as long as they end up
in the same place in time)

go forward as actor X and hope for a better RNG with a larger civilazation that ends up dying of just faster.

perspective: actor X (dead)

the possibilities of actor X are slim, this version of actor X will for all forseable future be dead.
but some actor could kill actor P and in that new timeline create a reality where actor X is alive.

(?) time travel charges: there are a fixed amount in circulation over all of the entire game

constants:
time charges have a spawn point in space, and time.
infinite duplication glitch must be fixed. (or illegal move orders)

functionality: 1 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
the time charge has a route, like a bus, where a bus stop is a fragment in space time.

0123456789
--    - -
    +-
+++ -+ -

the time travel charges must coninside on the same bus map, the timelines can't contain paradoxes.

functionality: 2 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
charges are used immediately, creating a branch, either forward or backwards in time

merging time travel charges:
if you can make two (or more) timelines have the same conditions, (at the same time, maybe?) one
time travel charge will be returned after the merge
this can be useful to test if a strategy you had in mind was feasable or not.

so if you remembered who was alive and what the prices of the economy was
and you manage to get it spot on, you will get your time travel charge back.


maybe diffrent number amount of things depending on the current difficulty like:

# easy difficulty
you have to stand in the same spot

# hardest difficulty
you should have the same inventory
every actor has to be in the same spot
every market price must match

# extreme difficulty
bullet count must match

you can now create a new timeline with the same time travel charge

backwards travel ++++++++++++++++++++++++

you can have 4 timelines running at the same time (one for each travel charge).

killing someone will cause you to travel to their birth and become them.
spending a time travel charge returning back will cause you to get it back.

or you can live a diffrent life as them.
or kill you're future murderer. opening a new timeline costing even another time travel charge
if you kill someone when all time travel charges are depleted, you will just be an og murderer
so relatives will be mad you're friends will hate you, noone would sell you stuff or visit you.


forwards travel +++++++++++++++++++++++++
if you play as a woman you will be able to have a child, when that child is birthed you will travel
to the point in time when the child is of the same age as you were when giving birth.

this won't cost a time travel charge (maybe?)

the goal of the game is to travel to a certain year in the future where you're unavoidable doom awaits.


now that is one version:

how to compute this?
easy!
economy?
basic ez!

the incentive for actors to behave however, and their capability of time traveling backwards or forwards.
is redundant because all is needed is to swap the brains if they at least one timeline is active.
