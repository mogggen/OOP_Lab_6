the feeling behind the game is to make your feel insignificant, and without purpose pursuing ordinary goals,
and slaughtering as many as possible across multiple time lines is way more fun


*rolls down from the top of the screen* 'M.U.D R.D'
*delay*
*'press any key to murder them'*

killing an NPC will start a new game, and introduce a crucial game mechanic at the same time,
killing NPCs will send you into a diffrent time into a diffrent person.

time travel was invented in 1944 (sure 52 weeks per year) and you can only travel between 1944 and 2025


the Title of the game is shown and you press start to kill the person right in front of you

the goal of the game is to show the player that no matter the consequences of your action,
the playthrough will always end up with the same ending, every one dying, if you can live to see it
end the game with the last two NPCs one's controlled by the player, the other one controlled by the player)
once they meet the logo of the game apears on screen and you're at the main menu automatically

so the game ends by placing you at the beginning of the playthrough,
portraiying to the player the self destructive (time) loop they have trapped them self in (hell loop)

problems

intrest growing overtime (by adding new items with inital value in the ball park of initally 140% of the previous items then 150%, and so on until 230%), so items own from the past is useless in the future economy
if the player is transported to the future 
causing frustration, and you will need to steal to stay alive

weekly however there is a possibility of getting to vote to change item values, the votes will average out, the NPCs will vote without reason (completely randomly at the begining narrowing in a price )

NPCs are capable of the same reasoning as the player (hopefully *fingers crossed*)

NPCs rioting if their pay is too unfairly divided


NPCs can buy houseing; the cost can vary severly


personal area and possessions

marketing job - personally
factory job
banker

THE COOLEST PROBLEM TO SOLVE
place a finite number of houses, jobs (units anyone can do anything for starting version)
dying of age is impossible, birth control is nonexistent
every NPC has their personal quota of the day that they will need to fill or resort to murder and stealing
NPCs will time travel when murdering another NPC and will start a new timeline
if it is in the past it will be randomly generated and the present will insantly change
if they are sent to the future the timeline will be paused until it's relevent,
the victim is dead for all future
time traveling NPCs to favor their own need

parallell timelines running simultaneously

someplaces time travel might be illegal.
other times
