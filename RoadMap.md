(kill/enslave the majority of enemies encountered to increase the fear of your foes)
(high fear factor means less likely to turn on you when you make questionable desition)


have loyalty/morale factor
(killing of friendly left and right will lower loyalty factors of witness)
low loyalty will cause disobidiants allies.
